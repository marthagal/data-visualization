# R code for making choropleth map of the United States

# state input date flows into object called my.data.frame
# state names in my.data.frame from the input data must match 
# state names in gadm.data.frame for the state topology

library(sp)  # spatial analysis in R
library(maptools)  # utilities for working with shapefiles and map projection
library(ggplot2)  # plotting utilities
library(colorspace)  # color functions like HLS() for hue, luminance, and saturation/chroma
library(maps)
library(mapproj)

library(Cairo)  # many output options for data visualization
# Cairo reference manual provides the following description of the package
# Cairo initializes a new graphics device that uses the cairo graphics library 
# for rendering. The current implementation produces high-quality PNG, 
# JPEG, TIFF bitmap files, high resolution PDF files with embedded fonts, 
# SVG graphics and PostScript files. It also provides X11 and Windows 
# interactive graphics devices. Unlike other devices it supports all graphics 
# features including alpha blending, anti-aliasing etc.

# Chang (2013) R Graphics Cookbook is a good reference for ggplot2 work
# here we enter the theme_clean function from Chang (2013) pages 317-318
# this will provide a map with no grid lines for longitude and latitude

# To prepare the geographical data for the United States map, 
# we download ESRI shapefiles from <www.gadm.org>. These provide 
# information for administrative/political areas worldwide.  
# We download shapefiles for the United States in RData format 
# for use in R. These define an R SpatialPolygonsDataFrame with a 
# longitude/latitude reference system. This R object will be used 
# in conjunction with the sp package. There are three levels 
# of detail available with these files, identified as levels 
# 0, 1, and 2. The corresponding data files are
# 
# USA_adm0.RData  # outline of the US
# USA_adm1.RData  # US with state boundaries
# USA_adm2.RData  # US with county boundaries

load("USA_adm1.RData")  # US with states shapefile from http://www.gadm.org/

print(ls()) # shows one object named gadm
print(str(gadm))  # class 'SpatialPolygonsDataFrame'... polygons needed for maps

# fortify() from ggplot2 converts to a data frame for use in ggplot2 maps 
# it is easier to work with the data frame object for bounding box selection
# and for merging with new data, as needed for the choropleth maps

# for the choropleth map... find a variable to plot for the states... 
# my choice for this sample program is SAT scores by state, with the data from
# <http://www.commonwealthfoundation.org/policyblog/detail/sat-scores-by-state-2013>
# note that participation rates vary greatly from state to state
# so the interpretation of mean scores is affected by the fact that students
# in the midwest who take the SAT are those who plan to apply to schools
# outside of the midwest (where the ACT is not accepted in place of SAT)
# these data were entered into a comma-delimited text file
