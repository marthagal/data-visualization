# DATASET DESCRIPTION AND PURPOSE OF EDA
#
# This dataset includes data about internet usage and Facebook usage. I will explore the dataset via an
# EDA to determine what characteristics are likely to be correlated with internet use and Facebook use,
# as well as the impact of Facebook on user's lives and the amount of time that is spent on Facebook. 
#
#
# Define Variables of Interest
#
# Internet/Facebook Usage variables that I am interested in exploring are:
#
# INTUSE - Internet User
# PIAL2 - Facebook User
# PIAL8 - Impact of Facebook on Your Life Overall
# PIAL9 - Time Spent on Facebook in the Past Year (Relative Change)
# PIAL10 - Expected Time Spent on Facebook in the Next Year (Relative Change)
# PIAL3 - Former Facebook User Status
# PIAL5 - Possible Future Facebook User
# PIAL6 - Break from Facebook User Status
#
# Demographic variables that I am interested in exploring are:
#
# SEX - The sex of the respondent
# AGE - Age of the respondent
# EMPLOY - Employment status of the respondent
# INCOME - Income of the respondent
# RACE - Race of the respondent
# PAR - Parenting status of the respondent
# EDUC2 - Educational status achieved by the respondent
#
# Free-from text fields are included in the EDA:
# PIAL4 - What made you stop using Facebook?
# PIAL7 - What made you decide to take a break from Facebook?
#
# I excluded some variables from the analysis. These included PIAL1, HISP, EMLOCC, and INTMOB, as I 
# thought that other variables covered these data points and therefore they were not necessary.
#
# Generally speaking, this analysis will first look at the overall distribution for each variable. Then,
# I will compare the Facebook variables with the demographic variables to look for correlation. Finally,
# I will compare some of the Facebook variables with each other, and then review the free-form text fields.



# EDA for Continuous Variables

# Age is the only continuous variable

# EDA for Categorical Variables
#
#
# Change Categorical Variables to Factors
#
# This will allow graphing of categorical variables versus other categorical variables.
#
# NOTE: Some of these variables were changed already to factors above; I recognize that it is not necessary to 
# repeat this step. Because I was learning as I went, I used different names in the graphs below and those above, 
# and I elected to keep the reinitialization of the factors to the "new" names rather than to re-do everything with 
# consistent names and only initialize the factors once. Essentially, I am starting over here as far as the 
# variables and data subsets are concerned. In the future, I will not duplicate this work.
